C++ - Module 02

Topics:
Ad-hoc polymorphism, operators overload and orthodox canonical classes

New rules:
From now on, all your classes must be designed in the Orthodox Canonical Form,
unless explicitely stated otherwise. Then, they will implement the four required member
functions below:
• Default constructor
• Copy constructor
• Copy assignment operator
• Destructor
Split your class code into two files. The header file (.hpp/.h) contains the class
definition whereas the source file (.cpp) contains the implementation.
