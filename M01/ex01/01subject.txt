Exercise : 01
Moar brainz!
Turn-in directory : ex01/
Files to turn in : Makefile, main.cpp, Zombie.{h, hpp}, Zombie.cpp, zombieHorde.cpp
Forbidden functions : None

Time to create a horde of Zombies!

Implement the following function in the appropriate file:
	Zombie* zombieHorde( int N, std::string name );
		It must allocate N Zombie objects in a single allocation. Then, it has to initialize the
		zombies, giving each one of them the name passed as parameter. The function returns a
		pointer to the first zombie.
Implement your own tests to ensure your zombieHorde() function works as expected.

Try to call announce() for each one of the zombies.

Donâ€™t forget to delete all the zombies and check for memory leaks.
