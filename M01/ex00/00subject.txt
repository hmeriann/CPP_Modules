An easy one, to start with.
Make a Pony class, containing whatever you think adequately describes a pony. Then,
create two functions, ponyOnTheHeap and ponyOnTheStack, in which you will allocate a
Pony, and make it do some stuff.
Of course, in the first one, the Pony must be allocated on the heap, on in the second
one it must be allocated on the stack.
You will provide a main with enough code to prove what you made works as intended.
In both cases, the Pony objects must not exist after the function hands off control.
(Your main will also have to demonstrate this during the correction!)
